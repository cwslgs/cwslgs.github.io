        <div style="font-size: 20px">I made the background a light blue and the font a darker blue, since I remember that on some online tests they give you the options to change the background, and light blue was one of them. It feels like less strain on the eyes instead of straight white and black. The two blues pass the contrast test with an 8:1 contrast ratio. </div>

        <div style="font-size: 20px">I added titles so people know what the page is, in case it isn't loading or if they're using a screenreader. I tried to do a title for the first website submission, but I did it wrong, so this showed me how to fix that! I also added the English language denotement near the beginning of the code. I have home buttons on all of the pages as well as links for better maneueverability. The page is accessible without a mouse through using the tab button and arrow keys for navigation. The only page that might not continue these features is my math page, because I made it so if my students access it, they won't be able to go to the homepage without knowing to type in home.html.</div>
